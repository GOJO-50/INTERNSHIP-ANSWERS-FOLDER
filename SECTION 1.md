# SECTION 1

### WHY I AM INTO CODING or TECHNOLOGY ITSELF?

I've been asked this question by people and it gives me the pleasure to talk about it. I like expressing these things cause it reminds me of how i started and also gives me that self-discipline and motivation to stick to it. 

So, what got me interested in technology and coding was inspired by my uncle. I kind of look onto him. I'm the type of person whose so curios to know about a lot of things. In my mind the tech world is like a mystery and I'm so drowned into it to find about those mysteries and solve them. Technology itself is so broad so i had to slow down and narrow stuffs a little. So coding gets me exited, like its just the summary of all I needed in the tech universe. And also I like solving problems and with tech and coding everything Is solved easily.



### PORJECT IDEA THAT COULD BE USE TO SOLVE RECENT ISSUES

For a while now, I've noticed that people are not familiar with a Database System. Most Businesses are running a local Database Management System which is not reliable cause data gets lost so easily.

But with the help of a well Designed Database System one could save all there data, stored in the cloud or a self owned storage which will even also aid you to retrieve Data's easily.
